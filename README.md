# dvd-screensaver

Little Python project simulating those old TV screensavers that had a DVD logo
bouncing around the screen.\
Features include:

- DVD Logo changes color when hitting an edge
- When hitting a corner, the program will play a sound effect to indicate this
  - it is quite loud, I recommend turning the volume down for this program

Notes:

- Although rare, sometimes the DVD Logo appears invisible until it bounces to
  the next wall. This is because the color _can_ be set to black or other dark
  shades. Not fixing this because it's funny.
- This is probably way more complicated than it needs to be. If there is a
  simpler way to accomplish any of this, please feel free to let me know and /
  or submit a pull request! The only request I have is that the code is in the
  end readable and makes sense.
